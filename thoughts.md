Idea: homeassistant dashboard kiosk.
parts (already purchased and setup):

- raspberry pi 3b+
- mpi7002 7 inch capacitive touch screen
- surrounded by a small acryillic frame (181.5mm x 121.5mm x 13.5 mm)

problem: want to make a mount/frame for this device.
specifications:
should have some hardware hardware interface (rotary dials) mounted on it, I'm thinking 4x rotary dials (KY-040? but not fussed) purchased from aliexpress hooked up to an esp32 which communicates to the server separately for simplicity.

- want the device to mount on the wall.
- want it to be a beautiful and robust part of the home with a sturdy design, and a tasteful design, loosely inspired by european and japanese 1980s and 1990s premium hifi equipment (see screenshots)
- want parts to be designed using beginner friendly methods and with assistance of AI agents. want formats which can be sent to china production companies that can C&C from designs or 3d print or similar.

- rough-design.png has a general sketch with red letters labelling things,
  a) would be a perspex/glass?/clear plastic/acryllic part which the screen + pi would be mounted onto
  b) would be metal
  c) i dunno, but to mount a to b.
